  <p class="lead">Design should be the meeting of form and function.</p>
  <p class="lead">I believe in thinking outside of the box to solve everyday problems.  With over 30 years of combined design experience, I love solving the problems that most people ignore.</p>

  <p class="lead">Not only do I enjoy the challenge of solving these problems, I also like to help others realize their 
  ideas.  I believe that everyday there are people out coming up with creative solutions who lack the knowadge to bring them to reality.  I want to help get those ideas out of the shadows and into the market.<p>
